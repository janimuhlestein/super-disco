# Work Day Scheduler

Features:

1. Displays current day.
2. When user clicks on the p element on the text section, it becomes a textarea.
3. When they click on the save button, it returns to a p.
4. The existing tasks are then saved to localStorage, so that the user can refresh
    their browser without losing it.
5. The application checks to see if the currrent hour is equal to the hour row.
6. If so, the application sets that row to be red.
7. It the current hour is greater than the hour row, it is set to gray.
8. If the current hour is less than the row hour, it is set to green.
9. Force refresh of calendar every 30 minutes.
10. If the hour is greater than 17 (5:00PM), clear the localStorage as the day is over.
